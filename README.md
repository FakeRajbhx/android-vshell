# android-vshell

vShell is an application for Android OS that runs Alpine Linux distribution
on QEMU x86_64 hardware emulator. It has been made by `@xeffyr` originally,
a [Termux](https://github.com/termux) maintainer which is retired now.

# A letter to @rajbhx from @xeffyr

Even though I have deleted my account, you (`@rajbhx`) IS NOT ALLOWED to
impersonate me, especially in order to distribute the associated software.

```
Hi there!

I understand your intentions to keep projects like "Alpine Term" and "vShell" available, but you are impersonating `@xeffyr` without appropriate permission. Therefore I kindly request you (@rajbhx) to take down the GitHub organization https://github.com/xeffyr created by you. If you want to keep repositories, please transfer them under your account or organization with a *different* name.

On side note: while "Alpine Term" and "vShell" were open source projects, you are not allowed to take over the maintainership without making a fork. You are also violating the GPL-3.0 license by not providing the source code under these repositories:
* https://github.com/xeffyr/alpine-term
* https://github.com/xeffyr/android-vshell

Please, stop!
```
